add linting. Hard to test this. adding linting rules
npm run lint, get rid of assert in get_data.js, index.js. 

the linting rules conflict with node. node requires assert but eslint calls this an error. 

import data from './MOCK_DATA.json' assert { type: "json" }
which has an assert which is not necessary for node 18. But node generates an error message without it in different versions of node. 

eslint rule conflicts with node, need the assert
